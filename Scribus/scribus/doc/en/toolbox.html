<h2>My Linux DTP Tool Box</h2>

<p>This is a selection of important tools to be used with Scribus,
based fairly narrowly on
how reliably these applications work with Scribus for print.
Some of these apps have been
tested within the limitations of modern PC hardware, for example:
telling
XNview to create 10,000 thumbnails at once. <br>

<h4>A note on PDF Viewers:</h4>

<p>One of the challenges with PDF in general is that
Scribus creates high-end PDF files. Sometimes their features are beyond
the capabilities of some open
source viewers, while necessary for reliable
commercial printing and only supported in commercial pre-press or DTP
tools. Years of working with Scribus have led to the strongly
held conclusion that the following viewers are the most reliable
at displaying PS/EPS/PDF created by Scribus:</p>

<ul>

  <li><strong>Adobe Reader 7.x or later</strong> â€“ The best and
sometimes the only choice for PDF viewing. Detailed notes and hints: <a href="toolbox1.html">Adobe Reader.</a> </li>
  <li><strong>GSview 4.8+</strong> with the latest version of
Ghostscript available. This combination is your best choice for viewing
EPS files, PS files and most PDFs. In addition, GSview has many other
very useful capabilities with add-ons like <code>pstoedit</code> and <code>epstool</code>.
For more detailed notes and hints: <a href="toolbox6.html">GSview</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If any other PDF or EPS viewer you choose cannot display
PDFs from Scribus, but they do view properly in Adobe Reader, file
a bug with the upstream author. It cannot be stressed this enough. In
virtually all cases that have been tested, it is a limitation of the
viewing
application. Scribus PDFs are tested daily with specialist pre-press
software to validate their adherence to the published PDF
specifications.</strong></p>
