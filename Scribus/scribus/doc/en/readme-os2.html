<h2>Scribus on OS/2 Warp4&#0174; and eComStation&#0153;</h2>

<p>The Scribus Team is much obliged to Paul Smedley for taking pains over porting Scribus to the OS/2 and eComStation platforms.</p>

<p>The Scribus Team also wants to thank <a href="http://www.serenity-systems.com/">Serenity Systems</a> for supporting development and testing of the OS/2 and eComStation port.</p>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>In addition to the installer, the following requirements have to be met:
<ul>
<li>A copy of libc063.dll, which can currently be downloaded from ftp://ftp.netlabs.org/pub/gcc/libc-0.6.3-csd3.zip, and gcc434.dll, which can be downloaded from http://download.smedley.info/gcc434.zip. Both files need to copied to C:\OS2\DLL (OS/2) or C:\ECS\DLL (eComStation).</li>
<li>Ghostscript and Python 2.6 (available from http://os2ports.smedley.info) are required to support some functionality. For instance, Python scripts won&rsquo;t work if Python is missing. The print preview and EPS import will not work if Ghostscript isn&rsquo;t available.</li>
<li>It also requires the Qt4 GA dll&rsquo;s that can be downloaded as a WarpIn package from http://svn.netlabs.org/qt4</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Known issues</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Printing support is not complete, but PDF export is. You can easily print via Acrobat Reader or another PDF viewer as a temporary workaround.</li>
<li>As for Acrobat/Adobe Reader on OS/2, please read the detailed hints in the <a href="toolbox1.html">toolbox section</a>.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>You can also sponsor/support the <a href="http://www.mensys.com/NetlabsQT4">Qt4 for OS/2 project</a> &ndash; without the Netlabs Qt4 project, this port could not exist!</p>
