<h2>Color Palettes in Scribus (1): Open Source Palettes</h2>
<p>Note that all color palettes described here and in subsequent sections include three basic colors: 100% CMYK Black (C:&nbsp;100, M:&nbsp;100, Y:&nbsp;100, K:&nbsp;100), 100% CMYK White (C:&nbsp;0, M:&nbsp;0, Y:&nbsp;0, K:&nbsp;0), and the <a href="color1.html">Registration Color</a>. These will not be counted as separate colors in the tables.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that no physical reference (color fan, color chips) exists for the colors in the palettes listed on this page, so that verification of color correctness is impossible.</p><br>

      <td>A set of primary CMYK and RGB colors, as well as three variants of black, namely &ldquo;Cool Black&rdquo;, &ldquo;Rich Black&rdquo; and &ldquo;Warm Black&rdquo;. The latter consist of a mix of C, M, Y and K colors instead of just 100% K (K=Black) and the values are the result of intensive discussions between the Scribus Team and commercial printers. The &ldquo;Rich Black&rdquo; variants may not meet every printer's needs, but they can serve as a basis when it comes to printing a rich black.</td>
