<h2>Scribus Basics</h2>
<h3>Why Page Layout is Different from Word Processing</h3>

<p>What can you do with Scribus &ndash; and what is a &ldquo;page layout&rdquo; program? </p>
<p>One thing you should be aware of is that Scribus, like almost all DTP programs, is very different from a word processor. It is very important to understand the fundamental difference! Scribus belongs to the family of applications known as page layout programs or more commonly known as Desktop Publishing programs. These programs give users great flexibility in placing objects like photos, logos, text frames and shapes in the exact place where they want them.  This short introduction, together with the <a href="qsg.html">Quick Start Guide</a>, is meant to give a first time user a sense of what Scribus can do and how to avoid mistakes.</p>

<h3>The Final Assembly Line</h3>
<p>First time users of page layout applications like Scribus can find starting out quite frustrating. The interface seems approachable and familiar enough, but when you make your beginning steps things often do not quite work as expected. Do not make the mistake of launching Scribus, opening a new document and expect to start typing, because it won&rsquo;t work!</p>
<p>You can compare a document that will be sent to a commercial printer or uploaded to the web to a car or a computer. Such a machine consists of thousands of parts, most of which haven&rsquo;t even been produced by the car or computer manufacturer himself, but by suppliers. What the manufacturer does is assembling the parts into the final product, and that&rsquo;s exactly the main purpose of a layout program: It&rsquo;s the final assembly line of a document that is going to be published &ndash; most likely in print &ndash; hence the name &ldquo;Desktop <i>Publishing</i>&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Workflow</h3>
<p>Manufacturing complex machines requires an enormous amount of planning: Resources like available plants and employees must be taken into consideration, as well as the materials required to build the machines. It also requires coordination with suppliers, since modern machines are made of complex parts, which are often tailored to the final product, which, in turn, means that the suppliers, too, have to allocate resources, buy materials etc. The whole process of planning, coordination and production is called <b>&ldquo;workflow&rdquo;</b>, and if you remember that Desktop Publishing is the final assembly of visually complex documents, the process needs to be applied here as well.</p>

<h4>Planning</h4>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you want to build a complex machine or create a complex layout &ndash; in both cases it often starts, quite literally, at the drawing board. Many products, including cars, have been first &ldquo;created&rdquo; on a sheet of paper. Thus, in design, it&rsquo;s often a good idea to switch off the computer and use a sketch block to outline your future layout.</p>
<p>Since there are many inspiring designs for almost every purpose available, it&rsquo;s often unnecessary to re-invent the wheel. Learning from the masters in the art will probably help you further with becoming creative yourself than anything else. It also helps to read a few books on page layout, typography or color theory &ndash; there are many available, and most of them are full of inspiring examples.</p>
<p>Learning from existing examples is something different than copying a layout &ndash; it&rsquo;s actually hard work, because you need to analyze a layout, for example by using a ruler to determine page margins, dimensions etc. If you&rsquo;re serious about learning, you&rsquo;ll learn quickly that a good ruler can be one of your most valuable tools.</p>
<p>Once you think you have created a great layout on your drawing block, the analyzing doesn&rsquo;t stop, quite the contrary! Part of the planning stage is to determine which parts of your layout are static and should become part of a <a href="pagetemplate1.html">Master Page</a>. You also need to find out which elements will be repeatedly used in different places of your layout, as you can store all those elements in a single directory that can be used as a Scrapbook folder etc.</p>
<p>Layout considerations aside, there is another important aspect to your project planning, namely the other side of the assembly process, which, in our case, is commercial printing. It is <b>very</b> important to know what kind of files (e.g. PDF versions) a printer can handle, and if you plan to use <a href="color1.html">spot colors</a>, you should know in advance which colors the printer can reliably reproduce. All this information will influence the next stages of production on your side.</p>
<h4>Preparing Your Suppliers</h4>
<p>Just like a manufacturer of machines is coordinating with its suppliers to avoid frictions and hickups during the final assembly, you can avoid problems by providing guidelines to those who will produce the &ldquo;components&rdquo; of your layout (and if you do everything yourself, you can make some mental notes to avoid hassles down the road).</p>
<p>For writers it should be clear which file formats are acceptable. Ideally, only a single file format should be used, and if that&rsquo;s impossible, perhaps due to different software tools available, plain text files can be used as the lowest common denominator. Writers should also be advised to use consistent spelling, quotes dashes etc.</p>
<p>As for graphics files, you should figure out which <a href="importhints.html">file formats</a> work best for you and then ask contributors of graphics not to use anything else. You should also provide clear guidelines for the use of <a href="color1.html">spot colors</a>, image resolutions and <a href="cms.html">color profiles</a>.</p>
<h4>Getting Ready to Work</h4>
<p>From experience it can be told that the final layout should only be started when you have collected all the components you need, and that&rsquo;s especially true for text. If an image needs color corrections it can be done with the layout in place, but changes to a text, like adding a line or even a paragraph can result in a <b>lot</b> of extra work, as the placement of graphics or captions needs to be adjusted. Thus, make sure that no surprises happen down the line.</p>
<p>Before you start your work, it&rsquo;s alyways recommended, to collect all project files in a single project directory, with subdirectories for text, vector graphics and image files. Files that you want to re-use often should be moved into a single Scrapbook directory for use in Scribus. Once you&rsquo;ve done all this, you are ready to go&nbsp;...</p>
