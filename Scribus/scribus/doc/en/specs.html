<h2>Scribus Specifications</h2>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>Scribus is an Open Source, cross-platform desktop publishing (DTP) program. Originally developed on Linux, Scribus also runs natively on *BSD, Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X 10.5 or later, OS/2 Warp&nbsp;4, eComStation and Windows 2000 or later. The goal of the Scribus Team is to enable beginners to create professional-grade page layout and output, without limiting the advanced requirements of professional designers.</p>
<h3>General:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Scribus uses an XML-based file format, so that Scribus files (SLA) can be easily edited with a text editor or manipulated via Scripts (Perl, Python etc.).</li>
	<li>Frames that can be edited more flexibly than in most other DTP programs.</li>
	<li>Master Pages and Page Palettes allow for easy page management</li>
	<li>Document-wide layers: Items can be moved between layers, and it's possible to apply blend modes and transparency to individual layers. </li>	
	<li>Object linking, grouping, moving, locking, resizing and converting between different object types.</li>
	<li>A sophisticated Scrapbook allows for easy sharing of design objects (such as text blocks, logo images, backgrounds etc.) between documents or via a network.</li>
	<li>Render Frames allow for importing LaTeX formulas and other markup content directly into frames, as well as editing the markup code in an integrated editor.</li>
